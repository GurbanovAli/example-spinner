Chapter 3: AnimatedSprite, Spritesheets, TexturePacker
(Reuse game.html, game.css and all js files from the previous chapter)

Task:
1. Install and setup TexturePacker (see folder TexturePacker)
2. Create a sprite sheet with all animations in it using TexturePacker (amapixijs) and add it in the loader
3. Add a simple win check (check if the symbols on line 1 are the same -> win)
4. If a win combination appears, play the correct symbol animation on the winning symbol on each reel 
   until the start button is pressed and the next game is starting

Watch demo3.mp4 to see how the result should look like!
